NAME
    "CGI::Echo" - Echo form data to test form design.

Synopsis
    This is complete, tested program:

            #!/usr/bin/perl -wT

            use lib '.';
            use strict;

            use CGI;
            use CGI::Echo;

            # -----------------------------------------------

            my($q) = CGI -> new();

            CGI::Echo -> new(q => $q) -> print();

Description
    This module accepts form data, cleans it, and echos it.

    It is designed for a HTML/CGI student enviroment. It lets, indeed
    encourages, students to design forms and gives their long-suffering
    instructors a simple way to provide a CGI script which accepts the form
    data, and just echos it.

Distributions
    This module is available both as a Unix-style distro (*.tgz) and an
    ActiveState-style distro (*.ppd). The latter is shipped in a *.zip file.

    See http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/installing-a-module.html for
    help on unpacking and installing each type of distro.

Usage
    See the synopsis.

Options
    Here, in alphabetical order, are the options accepted by the
    constructor, together with their default values.

    css => ''
        This is the name of a CSS file which makes the sample form and the
        echoed data look pretty.

        See examples/default.css for a sample CSS file.

    q => ''
        This is the CGI object used by "CGI::Echo" to do the work.

    title => 'Echo Test'
        This is the text used in the page title and as a heading when the
        form data is echoed.

Methods
    new(%arg): The constructor
        See the previous section for details.

    print(%arg): Display the form data
        Call this to output a table containing the form data.

        print(%arg) takes the same parameters as new().

    set(%arg): Set class member options
        Call this to set options after calling new().

        set(%arg) takes the same parameters as new().

A Sample Form
    The synopsis in Echo.pm contains the only script you'll need. You'll
    find the code in examples/echo.cgi.

    A sample form, examples/test-echo.html, is shipped to bootstrap the
    design process.
